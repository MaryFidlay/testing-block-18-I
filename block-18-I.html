*Should return a single array of odd numbers in ascending order.
*Should not include even numbers
*When multiples of the same odd number in the array should just show once

Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to be an array.
Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to be equal to [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15].
Expect concatOdds([2, 4, 6], [1, 2, 3]) to be equal to [1, 3].
Expect concatOdds([1, 5, 12], [3, 5, 12]) to be equal to [1, 3, 5, 12].
Expect concatOdds([2, 4, 6], [2, 2, 2]) to be equal to [].
Expect concatOdds([2, 4, 6], [a, 2, 2]) to be an error.
Expect concatOdds([2, 4, 6], [a, b, c]) to be an error.
Expect concatOdds([2, 4, 6], [undefined]) to be an error.
